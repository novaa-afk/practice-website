I'm not the one that you call to talk to when you can't sleep
I'm just a fly on the wall, the shoulder you never need
But darlin', you're my everything, and I just wanna make you see
Everything that we could be, could we? Hm<br />

<br />
My friends say that I'm insane about you
And maybe it's true<br />

<br />
I might be delusional
But girls like you ain't usual
I know it's fantasy to think you'll fall for me
But in my mind we're beautiful, so<br />

<br />
Before you go and ruin my reality
Could you let me dream just a little?
'Cause I might be delusional
Delusional for you, oh<br />

<br />
I'm asking all of your friends if I ever cross your mind (yeah)
They say it's all in my head, that I shouldn't waste my time
But darlin', I would wait right here, even for a thousand years
I wanna be the one you're near, oh<br />

<br />
My friends say that I'm insane about you
And darlin', it's true<br />

<br />
I might be delusional
But girls like you ain't usual
I know it's fantasy to think you'll fall for me
But in my mind we're beautiful, so <br />

<br />
Before you go and ruin my reality
Could you let me dream just a little?
'Cause I might be delusional
Delusional for you<br />

<br />
Before you go and ruin my reality
Could you let me dream just a little?
'Cause I might be delusional
Delusional for you

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you <br />

<br />
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy <br />

<br />
And it was enchanting to meet you <br />

<br />
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you <br />

<br />
The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you <br />

<br />
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you <br />

<br />
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you <br />

<br />
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you <br />

<br />
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you <br />

<br />
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you

I look at you, you make me blind
Why do you have to be so beautiful all the time?
I know I can't be with you
It's killing me to see you with someone else
What to do? <br />

<br />
Now I am in the corner and watching you smile
Watching you smile
And I can't get over you
I'm losing my mind <br />

<br />
All of the things that I wish I could tell you
Every time when you're passing me by
I fall in love, there's something about you
I wish you were mine
And if I only could be there to hold you
It feels like I stop breathing when you're around
I'm in love, there's something about you
I wish you were mine <br />

<br />
So many times I wanted to
Put my arms around you just to be close to you
And in my head it's just you and I
And I don't know why I feel this way <br />

<br />
Now I'm in the corner watching you smile
Watching you smile, yeah
Now I can't get over you
I'm losing my mind, but <br />

<br />
All of the things that I wish I could tell you
Every time when you're passing me by
I fall in love, there's something about you
I wish you were mine
And if I only could be there to hold you
It feels like I stop breathing when you're around
I'm in love, there's something about you
I wish you were mine <br />

<br />
I wish you were mine
I wish you were mine
'Cause every time
You pass me by
I fall in love
I fall in love <br />

<br />
All of the things that I wish I could tell you
Every time when you're passing me by
I fall in love, there's something about you
I wish you were mine
And if I only could be there to hold you
It feels like I stop breathing when you're around
I'm in love, there's something about you
I wish you were mine, oh <br />

<br />
There's something about you
I wish you were mine

Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old <br />

<br />
You're dripping like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowing sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearing through the pages and the ink <br />

<br />
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue <br />

<br />
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
You were a vision in the morning
When the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you 
You said you'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you <br />

<br />
You're dripping like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowing sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearing through the pages and the ink <br />

<br />
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue <br />

<br />
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue <br />

<br />
You were red and you liked me 'cause I was blue
But you touched me and suddenly I was a lilac sky
And you decided purple just wasn't for you <br />

<br />
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue <br />

<br />
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue <br />

<br />
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue

The sun's goin' down
As I try to make my way through the crowd
Feeling alive, I love being by your side
It makes me shine <br />

<br />
We got one summer so let's make it count
You make me feel like everything's alright
Let's dance our problems away in the night
Love being right next to you <br />

<br />
You'll be on my mind
I'll be dreaming 'bout this 'til the end of time
We are young, we are free, down for the ride
Might be over tomorrow but we got to stay forever <br />

<br />
Do you hear that sound?
Can you feel the music, let's get wild?
We're magic, you and I
They got us reckless
But we don't mind <br />

<br />
We got one summer so let's make it count
You make me feel like everything's alright
Let's dance our problems away in the night
Love being right next to you <br />

<br />
You'll be on my mind
I'll be dreaming 'bout this 'til the end of time
We are young, we are free, down for the ride
Might be over tomorrow but we got to stay forever
Yeah, we got the summer forever <br />

<br />
If it's only for now, I don't mind
'Cause I know that your love is endless
If it's only for now, I don't mind
'Cause I know that your love is endless
It might be over tomorrow, but this day will live on forever <br />

<br />
You'll be on my mind
I'll be dreaming 'bout this 'til the end of time
We are young, we are free, down for the ride
Might be over tomorrow but we got to stay forever <br />

<br />
Live on, live on forever

You can relax, my friend
Huh?
I can tell you're getting nervous, so do yourself a service
And try to relax, my friend
I'm fine, Polites
Think of all that we have been through
We'll survive what we get into <br />

<br />
I know that you're tired of the war and bloodshed
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to live?
Look at how you grip your sword, enough said
Why should we take when we could give?
You can show a person that you trust them
When you stop and lower your guard
Here we have a chance for some adjustment
Give it a try, it's not that hard
I'm telling you <br />

<br />
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms <br />

<br />
(Welcome)
Stay back!
(Stay back, stay back)
My friend, greet the world with open arms
We're only here for food
(Food, food) <br />

<br />
Six hundred friends are waiting for us to show our faces
(Food)
Stay back, I'm warning you
(Food)
If we don't get back safely
My men will turn this place into blazes
(Here you go!)
See? <br />

<br />
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world, here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms <br />

<br />
My friend
I wish that I could say that I agree
But look at the way this fruit is glowing
And filled with glowing seeds
It took me a while to notice just what kind of fruit they eat
It's a lotus, it controls your mind and never lets you free
That's what we'd get with open arms <br />

<br />
Lotus-eaters
I'd like to show my friend that kindness is brave
Could you tell me where there's other food to eat?
(The cave! Scary cave)
A cave?
You're saying there's a cave where we could feast?
And where do we sail to find this food-filled cave? <br />

<br />
(East, that way)
Thank you
(Welcome!) <br />

<br />
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
I see in your face, there is so much guilt inside your heart
So why not replace it and light up the world? Here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms
You can relax, my friend
